\# Problem Statement



User manuals and instructional documents are designed to guide users toward correct and safe operation of products and systems. However, a significant number of real-world failures occur even when users attempt to follow the provided instructions. These failures are often caused by linguistic issues such as ambiguity, implicit assumptions, unclear sequencing, and excessive cognitive load, leading to instruction misuse.



Current evaluation approaches rely heavily on usability testing, expert reviews, and post-deployment feedback, which are reactive, costly, and limited in scalability. There is a lack of automated methods that can proactively analyze instructional language to identify potential misuse risks prior to deployment.



This project addresses this gap by proposing a language-driven framework that analyzes the linguistic characteristics of user manuals to predict instruction misuse risks. The objective is to enable early detection of misuse-prone instructions and provide actionable insights for improving instructional clarity and safety.



\## Objectives



\- To formally define instruction misuse from a language-centric perspective.

\- To identify linguistic patterns that contribute to user misunderstanding despite instruction compliance.

\- To develop an NLP-based framework for predicting misuse-prone instructional content.

\- To generate structured risk indicators that support manual revision and quality assurance.



\## Scope



\- The framework focuses exclusively on text-based user manuals and instructional documents.

\- The analysis is limited to language-induced misuse, excluding hardware failures or deliberate user negligence.

\- The system is designed as a pre-deployment evaluation tool rather than a real-time user monitoring solution.
