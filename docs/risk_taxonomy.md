\# Instruction Misuse Risk Taxonomy



This section defines the categories of instruction misuse risks considered in the proposed framework. The taxonomy is derived from common linguistic patterns observed in instructional documents that lead to user misunderstanding despite compliance.



\## 1. Ambiguity Risk



Instructions that contain vague terms, unclear references, or multiple possible interpretations.



\*\*Example:\*\*

"Use the device when it is ready."



\*\*Risk Explanation:\*\*

The term "ready" is undefined and may be interpreted differently by users.



---



\## 2. Implicit Assumption Risk



Instructions that assume prior knowledge, environmental conditions, or user expertise that is not explicitly stated.



\*\*Example:\*\*

"Reconnect the internal cable after maintenance."



\*\*Risk Explanation:\*\*

The instruction assumes the user knows which cable is referred to.



---



\## 3. Sequence Dependency Risk



Instructions where the correct execution depends on an implicit order of steps that is not clearly specified.



\*\*Example:\*\*

"Insert the cartridge and power on the device."



\*\*Risk Explanation:\*\*

The order of actions is critical but not explicitly enforced.



---



\## 4. Cognitive Overload Risk



Instructions that combine multiple actions or conditions into a single step, increasing the likelihood of error.



\*\*Example:\*\*

"Press the reset button while holding the power switch and reconnecting the cable."



\*\*Risk Explanation:\*\*

Multiple simultaneous actions increase user cognitive load.



---



\## 5. Low Risk / Clear Instruction



Instructions that are explicit, well-scoped, and unlikely to be misused.



\*\*Example:\*\*

"Turn off the device using the power button before opening the back panel."



\*\*Risk Explanation:\*\*

The instruction is clear, ordered, and unambiguous.
