instruction_text,risk_type,risk_explanation
"Use the device when it is ready.",AMBIGUITY,The term 'ready' is undefined and may be interpreted differently.
"Reconnect the internal cable after maintenance.",IMPLICIT_ASSUMPTION,The instruction assumes the user knows which cable is referred to.
"Insert the cartridge and power on the device.",SEQUENCE_DEPENDENCY,The order of actions is important but not explicitly stated.
"Press the reset button while holding the power switch and reconnecting the cable.",COGNITIVE_OVERLOAD,Multiple actions in a single step increase cognitive load.
"Turn off the device using the power button before opening the back panel.",LOW_RISK_CLEAR,The instruction is explicit and clearly ordered.

"Operate the system under normal conditions.",AMBIGUITY,The term 'normal conditions' is not defined.
"Adjust the settings appropriately before use.",AMBIGUITY,The word 'appropriately' is vague.
"Ensure proper installation before powering on.",AMBIGUITY,The term 'proper' lacks specification.
"Use sufficient force to secure the component.",AMBIGUITY,The amount of force required is unclear.
"Continue operation until the device responds.",AMBIGUITY,The expected response is not specified.

"Reattach the grounding wire after replacement.",IMPLICIT_ASSUMPTION,Assumes the user knows the location of the grounding wire.
"Calibrate the sensor before measurement.",IMPLICIT_ASSUMPTION,Calibration procedure is not explained.
"Restore factory settings if issues persist.",IMPLICIT_ASSUMPTION,Assumes knowledge of factory reset process.
